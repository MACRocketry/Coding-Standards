Coding Standards
================

What is this?
-------------
This is an in-progress document that clarifies our coding Standards

How to compile?
---------------
Get yourself a `pandoc` installation, and a `LaTeX` install.
If you need help with getting `LaTeX`, then use the instructions from [here.](https://www.ctan.org/starter)

Once you've got those things, just use the makefile to generate yourself a nice looking PDF file. The makefile is in progress, and will be updated with more filetypes later.
